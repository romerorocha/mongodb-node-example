Standard project using MongoDB and Node.js, to be used as a template.

## Libraries

- **mongoose** (MongoDB connection/handling)
- **mocha** (Testing)

## MongoDB setup

MongoDB should be installed locally and running at `localhost:27017`

## Node.js setup

Project creacted using **Node.js 10.15**. Older versions should be avoieded.

**Yarn** package manager was used, instead of **NPM**. Both should work well, anyway.
